      <p class="h1">Here are my calculations for resistors: <br>
      <h2>Blue LED:</h2>
      <div>
        \[
        5 - 3.3 = 0.02 \cdot \Omega \\
        \]
        \[
        \frac{1.7}{0.02} = \frac{0.02 \cdot \Omega}{0.02} \\
        \]
        \[
        85 = \Omega
        \]

      </div>
    

      <h2>Red and Green LEDs:</h2>
      <div>
        \[
        5 - 1.8 = 0.02 \cdot \Omega 
        \]
        \[
        \frac{3.2}{0.02} = \frac{0.02 \cdot \Omega}{0.02}
        \]
        \[
        160 = \Omega
        \]
      </div>
      I used 220 &Omega; resistors for the red LEDs and 100 &Omega; resistor for the blue LED, because they were the closest resistors available.

    <br><h3>Here is a gif of my circuit in action:</h3>
    <img src="A1_blink.gif" width="300" height="600" />
    <pre><p>
      1. Here is my graph:
      <img src="Voltage over time LED.png" width="500" height="300" />

      2. There are 14 I/O pins on the Arduino Uno board and 6 input pins so there could be 20 leds blinking independently.
      For the circuit to run correctly, the current would need to stay at about 20 mA.

      4. When testing different blink intervals, I was unable to detect even a flicker once the interval was down to 10 ms.

      5. Yes, I used Microsoft CoPilot to help me with some of the arduino code and some of the HTML.
      To figure out how to run 3 LEDs independently I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlTU9Vk9XVw">Youtube Tutorial</a>.
      I then asked Copilot to help correct my errors as I reworked it for 3 LEDs. While I was coding the HTML I asked Copilot
      for help formatting the code and LaTeX equations. It was able to give me partially helpful answers but I had to consult stackoverflow
      and documentation to get the Javascript CDNs to work correctly. I also asked for some reminders about small HTML formatting things.
